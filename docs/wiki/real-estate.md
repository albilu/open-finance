## Property Value History

Track how a property’s estimated value changes over time. Each update creates an immutable snapshot. Navigate to the property detail page → **Value History → Add Value** to record a new appraisal.

The value history chart in the property detail view shows how the value has appreciated or depreciated.

---

## Investment Simulations

Use the simulation tool to model a purchase-or-rent scenario for a property.

**Inputs:**

- Purchase price or rental cost
- Down payment amount
- Mortgage rate and term
- Expected annual value appreciation (%)
- Monthly costs (insurance, maintenance, taxes)
- Expected rental yield if bought as an investment

**Outputs:**

- Break-even period (buy vs rent)
- Net present value of ownership over N years
- Total return on investment
- Month-by-month cash flow projection

Simulations are saved and can be revisited for comparison.

## Equity Calculation

For properties with a linked mortgage, equity is calculated automatically:

> **Equity = Current Value − Outstanding Mortgage Balance**

This feeds into the net-worth dashboard, where real estate equity is shown alongside your other assets.
