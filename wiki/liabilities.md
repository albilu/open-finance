## Overview

The Liability module tracks money you owe — mortgages, personal loans, student loans, auto loans, credit cards. For each liability, Open-Finance calculates amortization schedules, projects total interest paid, and lets you record interest rate changes over time.

## Amortization Schedule

Open-Finance generates a month-by-month breakdown of your loan showing:

| Column    | Description                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Period    | Month number                    |
| Payment   | Total payment amount            |
| Principal | Portion reducing the balance    |
| Interest  | Portion going to interest       |
| Balance   | Remaining balance after payment |

This is displayed as a chart and table in the liability detail view.

## Total Interest Projection

The detail page shows:

- Total interest you will pay over the full loan term
- Total cost (principal + interest)
- Projected payoff date based on your current payment schedule

---

## Interest Rate Changes

If your lender changes your interest rate (common with variable-rate mortgages), you can record the change from the liability detail page → **Rate History → Add Rate Change**. Enter the new rate and the effective date. Open-Finance recalculates the remaining amortization schedule from that point forward.

---

## Linking Payments to Transactions

Each monthly payment can be linked to a transaction in your account. This lets you track actual payments made against your amortization schedule.
